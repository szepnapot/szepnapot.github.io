        <h2>Notable achievements</h2>
        <h3>Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve <br> Classic Race Champion.</h3>
        <p>
          In my spare time at Wald’s Parts junk shop I designed and built a Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of <br> 588 mph top speed. Went on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a human. <br> Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the course of my enslavement.
        </p>
        <h3>Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects</h3>
        <p>
          During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects <br> for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating  <br>Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of <br> the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon <br> torpedoes.
